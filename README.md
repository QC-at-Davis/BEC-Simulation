# BEC Simulation using `TrotterSuzuki`

Some very simple Bose-Enstein Condensate (BEC) simulations using the Python [`TrotterSuzuki`](https://trotter-suzuki-mpi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) package. The images produced can mostly be thought of as sanity checks.

* `Quick-Start.ipynb` is just the quick start from the documentation with some additional comments to help keep track of what's going on (either based on the documentation or some additioanl research)
* `Soliton-Phase-Imprinting.ipynb` is a modified version of [Dark Soliton Generation in Bose-Einstein Condensate using Phase Imprinting](https://trotter-suzuki-mpi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#dark-soliton-generation-in-bose-einstein-condensate-using-phase-imprinting) but relaxed/simplified setups to produce results that are more familiar to someone with an introductory understanding of quantum mechanics
